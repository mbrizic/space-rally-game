# Tasks

- [x] Scaffold Vite + Canvas2D
- [x] Fixed-timestep loop + keyboard input
- [x] Grid + HUD debug overlay
- [x] Placeholder car movement + draw
- [x] Vehicle dynamics v1 (bicycle model + slip angles)
- [x] Pedal steering core (traction circle + weight transfer)
- [x] Handbrake turns
- [x] Track (polyline ribbon) + checkpoints + timer
- [x] Smooth track (spline sampling)
- [x] Surfaces (tarmac/gravel/dirt) + off-track penalties
- [x] Hard track-edge collisions
- [x] Start countdown + GO

## Phase 2
- [x] Drift detection + HUD indicator (slip/saturation-based)
- [x] Particle system (pooled) + drift smoke/dust by surface
- [x] Track width variance by s (narrow/wide sections)
- [x] Add swerve/chicane sections to the track layout
- [x] Update off-track + collisions/rendering to respect varying width
- [x] Feedback polish: collision punch, clearer damage + surface cues

## Phase 3
- [x] Engine simulation (engine.ts) with RPM and power curves
- [x] Modular audio system (audio-engine.ts, audio-slide.ts)
- [x] Surface-dependent sliding sounds
- [x] RPM Meter HUD and gear indicator
- [x] Composable architecture for sim/audio components
