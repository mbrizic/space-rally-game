# Tasks

- [x] Scaffold Vite + Canvas2D
- [x] Fixed-timestep loop + keyboard input
- [x] Grid + HUD debug overlay
- [x] Placeholder car movement + draw
- [x] Vehicle dynamics v1 (bicycle model + slip angles)
- [x] Pedal steering core (traction circle + weight transfer)
- [x] Handbrake turns
- [x] Track (polyline ribbon) + checkpoints + timer
- [x] Smooth track (spline sampling)
- [x] Surfaces (tarmac/gravel/dirt) + off-track penalties
- [x] Hard track-edge collisions
- [x] Start countdown + GO

## Phase 2

- [ ] Drift detection + HUD indicator (slip/saturation-based)
- [ ] Particle system (pooled) + drift smoke/dust by surface
- [ ] Track width variance by s (narrow/wide sections)
- [ ] Add swerve/chicane sections to the track layout
- [ ] Update off-track + collisions/rendering to respect varying width
- [ ] Feedback polish: collision punch, clearer damage + surface cues
