# Story / Lore (Working)

This is a lightweight lore doc meant to:
- Keep the game’s tone consistent (serious driving, unserious world)
- Provide a foundation for UI flavor, missions, and future co‑op roles
- Explain why you’re doing high-speed rally driving while being shot at by zombies in space

## Tone

**Driving:** grounded rally seriousness (physics, surfaces, risk/reward).

**World:** frontier bureaucracy, bad corporate incentives, and absurd stakes played straight.

A good north star: *the world is ridiculous, but the characters treat it like a job with deadlines.*

## Naming Direction (Casual + “couch sayable”)

Constraints:
- The name should feel casual: “hey, let’s play X.”
- It can be long, but should have a short nickname/acronym.
- It should hint at rally realism + stupid sci‑fi danger.

### Canon: SCRAPS (the corporation)

**SCRAPS** is the megacorp brand plastered on every depot, clipboard, and loading bay.

They are not evil or sketchy — they legitimately do deliveries of everything from water filters to medical supplies. They’re just so bureaucratic that *their paperwork feels like a boss fight*. Also today they're very dysfunctional and barely held together with duct tape and rubber bands

Full name (official):
- **SCRAPS** — *Salvage Contracts & Risk-Adjusted Procurement Service*

What they do (in plain words):
- contracts + routing + deliveries (with “risk-adjusted” clauses that always seem to apply to you, not them)
- occasional salvage pickups (because leaving value in the field is “noncompliant”)

Corporate tagline / subtitle ideas:
- “Space is hard. Shipping shouldn’t be.”
- “Payloads stabilized. Deadlines optimized.”
- “Delivery is a science. Driving is your problem.”
- “Transit solutions for unpredictable surfaces.”
- “Hazard pay available (terms apply).”

### SCRAPS products (in-universe flavor)

SCRAPS has a product name for everything, and it all sounds like it was invented by a committee.

- The Navigator app is literally **SCRAPS RouteAssist™**.
- Vehicle telemetry calls the car “a delivery platform.”
- Every tutorial ends with “You are now SCRAPS-certified.”

Unofficially (what the crew says):
- They think SCRAPS stands for something else every time: “Space Crates And Parcel Stuff?” (Navigator: “No.”)
- They misunderstand “Risk-Adjusted” as “don’t spill the drinks.”
- They brag about being “SCRAPS-certified” because they watched a 3-minute training video.

## Premise

You’re two contractors running a planet-side delivery route between isolated settlements.

The planet is “colonized” in the way a spreadsheet says it is: there are roads, there are towns, and there’s a contract that says you must meet delivery SLAs.

Everything outside the road wants to kill you.

## The Job

**SCRAPS** runs the only supply chain that still moves, on paper.

Your team is assigned a barely-legal route:

- Town-to-town deliveries across procedurally generated stages
- Strict deadlines
- Volatile cargo that can’t be allowed to destabilize

Your paycheck is a joke.

Your hazard bonus is a bigger joke.

## The Planet

Pick a single planet name that’s memorable and slightly corny:
- **Vermillion-9** (sounds official, silly in practice)
- **Kestrel Prime** (heroic, but used for mundane deliveries)
- **Arroyo-β** (weird letter: instant sci-fi)

The important part: weather and terrain vary wildly, so the rally handling stays interesting.

## Towns / Outposts (Worldbuilding that maps to gameplay)

Towns aren’t just set dressing; they define stage vibes and constraints.

- **Mining Outpost**: dust, debris, sandstorms; heavy vehicles, wide roads, bad visibility.
- **Hydroponics Dome**: fog + rain; slick traction, glare, muffled audio.
- **Research Station**: electrical storms; minimap glitches, HUD flicker, sensor noise.
- **Refinery Town**: heat haze, fuel leaks; “volatile cargo” missions more common.

Each town can have a signature “contract clause” that changes how a run feels.

## The Threat (Zombies, but make it semi-hard)

The enemies are “zombies” in the colloquial sense: things that used to be people, now driven by something else.

Possible explanations that keep the tone grounded:
- **Parasite/Fungus**: colonists infected by a fast-spreading organism; they move like desperate humans, not fantasy undead.
- **Nanite Maintenance Swarm Gone Wrong**: “repair bots” that reanimate bodies as mobile parts-carts.
- **Corporate Security Disaster**: experimental crowd-control tech accidentally makes a permanent “riot.”

Tanks are not “bigger zombies,” but a different category:
- armored salvage drones
- industrial exosuits
- security walkers

## Characters (Two guys, one car)

**Driver**
- ex-rally driver (or just someone who *thinks* they’re a rally driver)
- treats this like a sport even when it’s obviously a nightmare job

**Navigator**
- the “adult in the room” who reads the map and the fine print
- becomes increasingly militant about meeting deadlines

The comedy comes from competence under absurd constraints.

## Volatile Cargo (Core mechanic + P3 hook)

Volatile cargo is the narrative reason you can’t “just stop and fight,” and it’s also a clean gameplay lever.

Baseline (P2 / current game):
- The cargo has a stability meter affected by:
  - impacts
  - prolonged drifting
  - offroad time
  - overheating (long high-RPM sections)
- If stability hits zero: failure state, or a dramatic penalty (time loss / forced pit stop)

### P3 role concept: Cargo Tech / Handler

In a 3-player mode, the third player’s job is to keep the payload stable *in real time*.

UI/interaction options:
- **“Keep it centered” mini-game**: cargo sways in a containment frame; player drags/tilts dampers to keep the indicator in the safe zone.
- **Active dampers**: limited “stabilize pulses” that reduce sway but consume power or materials.
- **Field repairs using cargo**: sacrifice small parts of the shipment as emergency fixes:
  - patch coolant leak
  - temporary tire sealant
  - quick battery swap

This creates a great moral/strategy loop:
- Deliver intact for maximum payout
- Or cannibalize the shipment to survive

## Contracts / Missions (Flavor + progression)

Every stage can be framed as a contract with clauses:
- “Deliver within 7:30”
- “No cargo stability violations”
- “Avoid corporate checkpoints”
- “Collect salvage”

This supports replayability without over-narrating.

## Future expansion ideas (Lore that becomes mechanics)

- **Faction reputation**: towns reward different behaviors (fast, safe, stealthy, violent).
- **Black market mods**: illegal tires/suspension/weapons that help performance but increase detection.
- **Route selection**: choose between safer long routes vs short dangerous ones.
- **Radio chatter**: the corp dispatcher speaks in SLA language while you’re being chased.

## One-sentence pitch (useful for store page / friends)

A serious-feeling rally game where two delivery idiots outrun weather, zombies, and deadlines on a hostile planet.
