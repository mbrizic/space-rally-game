# Pacenotes

This document captures the pacenotes situation so `TASKS.md` can stay as a short checklist.

## Status

Pacenotes are **removed**.

Rationale:
- The intended experience is a real co-driver reading the map and calling turns.
- Pacenotes UI/logic was distracting and not robust.

Code note:
- `src/sim/pacenotes.ts` is now a stub returning `null`.
